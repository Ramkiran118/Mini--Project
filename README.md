# 🌊 Prediction on Long Term Water Analysis using Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Seasonality

### 🧠 AI & Data Analytics Based Mini Project

This mini project presents a predictive analysis of long-term water quality using **Weighted Regression** techniques by incorporating **Time**, **Discharge**, and **Seasonal Patterns**. Leveraging the power of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Analytics**, the model aims to detect, analyze, and forecast changes in water quality over time — a vital aspect for environmental monitoring and sustainable resource management.

## 📌 Objective

To build a predictive model that analyzes long-term water quality trends by applying weighted regression based on:
- 📅 Time (chronological progression)
- 💧 Discharge (streamflow data)
- 🌦️ Seasonal variations (wet/dry seasons)

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python
- 📊 Pandas, NumPy
- 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- 🧪 Scikit-learn (ML modeling)
- 🧠 Statsmodels (for Weighted Regression)
- 📍 Jupyter Notebook

## 📚 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Historical water quality datasets containing pH, temperature, nitrate levels, etc.
   - Stream discharge and seasonal data from public repositories or open datasets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature scaling and transformation
   - Time-based indexing

3. **Weighted Regression Modeling**:
   - Regression models giving weight to time proximity and discharge intensity
   - Seasonality included as a categorical or cyclic variable
   - Analysis of trendlines and anomaly detection

4. **Prediction & Visualization**:
   - Long-term water quality forecasts
   - Seasonal and discharge-based comparisons
   - Graphs for trends and residuals
